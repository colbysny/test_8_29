# Composite Polymer Electrolytes

![Abstract Figure](assets/electrolyte_abstract.png)

I led the development of novel composite polymer electrolytes to improve the energy density and safety of sodium-ion batteries. After a thorough literature review, I introduced boron nitride (BN) filler to a poly(ethylene oxide)–sodium electrolyte. My goal was to optimize ionic conductivity by reducing crystallinity and increasing dissociated ion content. I managed the experimental workflow, supporting and collaborating with two theorists. I also analyzed and plotted the data in Python (scipy, pandas, and seaborn), including deconvoluting overlapping FTIR peaks and automating full width at half maximum measurements. 

My research established a non-monotonic relationship between BN, polymer crystallinity, and ionic conductivity. This finding was published in the [first of two peer-reviewed papers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c06455). The [second paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c01192) built on this knowledge, using a new salt, NaFSI, to increase conductivity (via increased dissociation). These results contribute to safer, more efficient solid polymer electrolytes and provide key insights into how fillers affect ion transport in solid-state batteries.

To complete this research project, I learned a wide variety of materials processing and characterization techniques:
- Glove box operation and air-free chemistry
- X-ray diffraction
- Scanning electron microscopy
- Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis
- FTIR and Raman spectroscopy
- Electrochemical impedance (dielectric) spectroscopy

# Thermal Coating Test Stand

I developed a thermal test stand to evaluate the cooling performance of composite roof coatings, which are intended to improve building energy efficiency and combat urban heat. Using Fusion 360, I designed a "model house" that could accommodate type T thermocouples (selected for their accuracy in the 50–100°C range), humidity sensors, and aluminum test substrates. I then 3D-printed the models with white ASA material, which minimized unwanted solar absorbance and prevented deformation (due to the high glass transition temperature of ASA). Finally, I integrated a pyranometer to measure solar flux, enabling representative outdoor testing under uncontrolled radiation conditions. 

After executing three control studies to confirm the system’s accuracy, I programmed an Omega data acquisition system to automate irradiation tests. This increased throughput 6x (previously 3 hours per sample) through parallel testing and automatic data logging. Finally, I analyzed and visualized my results in Python. The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the coatings in reducing thermal loads, contributing to the development of more energy-efficient roofing materials.

# Carbon Upcycled: CO2 Capture Reactor Concept

![Carbon valorization reaction scheme](assets/reactor_design.png)

I designed a self-sustaining reactor to commercialize innovative chemistry from Brookhaven National Lab (Nature Catalysis 7, 98–109, 2024). The reactor converts CO2 and water into valuable carbon nanofibers, with oxygen and hydrogen as byproducts. The hydrogen and oxygen are then combusted to power a thermocatalytic reactor, making the system truly carbon-negative. This concept could potentially become the first profitable carbon capture reactor in history.
I conducted a technoeconomic analysis of each process step, complementing my two teammates' research on the CO2 capture and carbon nanofiber markets. The concept was pitched in the Department of Energy’s Energy Tech University Prize competition, where it was selected as a national semifinalist.
