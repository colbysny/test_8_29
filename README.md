# Composite Polymer Electrolytes
I led the development of novel composite polymer electrolytes to improve the energy density and safety of sodium-ion batteries. After a thorough literature review, I introduced boron nitride (BN) filler to a poly(ethylene oxide)–sodium electrolyte. My goal was to optimize ionic conductivity by reducing crystallinity and increasing dissociated ion content. I managed the experimental workflow, supporting and collaborating with two theorists. I also analyzed and plotted the data in Python (scipy, pandas, and seaborn), including deconvoluting overlapping FTIR peaks and automating full width at half maximum measurements. 

My research established a non-monotonic relationship between BN, polymer crystallinity, and ionic conductivity. This finding was published in the [first of two peer-reviewed papers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c06455). The [second paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c01192) built on this knowledge, using a new salt system (NaFSI) to increase conductivity. These results contribute to safer, more efficient solid polymer electrolytes and provide key insights into how fillers affect ion transport in solid-state batteries.

To complete this research project, I learned a wide variety of materials processing and characterization techniques:
- Glove box operation and air-free chemistry
- X-ray diffraction
- Scanning electron microscopy
- Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis
- FTIR and Raman spectroscopy
- Electrochemical impedance (dielectric) spectroscopy

# Thermal Coating Test Stand
I developed a thermal test stand to evaluate the cooling performance of composite roof coatings, which are intended to improve building energy efficiency and combat urban heat. Using Fusion 360, I designed a "model house" that could accommodate type T thermocouples (selected for their accuracy in the 50–100°C range), humidity sensors, and aluminum test substrates. I then 3D-printed the models with white ASA material, which minimized unwanted solar absorbance and prevented deformation (due to the high glass transition temperature of ASA). Finally, I integrated a pyranometer to measure solar flux, enabling representative outdoor testing under uncontrolled radiation conditions. 

After executing three control studies to confirm the system’s accuracy, I programmed an Omega data acquisition system to automate irradiation tests. This increased throughput 6x (previously 3 hours per sample) through parallel testing and automatic data logging. Finally, I analyzed and visualized my results in Python. The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the coatings in reducing thermal loads, contributing to the development of more energy-efficient roofing materials.
