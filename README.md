#Composite Polymer Electrolytes
I led the development of novel composite polymer electrolytes to improve the energy density and safety of sodium-ion batteries. After a thorough literature review, I introduced boron nitride (BN) filler to a poly(ethylene oxide)â€“sodium electrolyte. My goal was to optimize ionic conductivity by reducing crystallinity and increasing dissociated ion content. I managed the experimental workflow, supporting and collaborating with two theorists.

My research established a non-monotonic relationship between BN, polymer crystallinity, and ionic conductivity. This finding was published in the [first of two peer-reviewed papers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c06455). The [second paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c01192) built on this knowledge, using a new salt system (NaFSI) to increase conductivity. These results contribute to safer, more efficient solid polymer electrolytes and provide key insights into how fillers affect ion transport in solid-state batteries.

To complete this research project, I learned a wide variety of materials processing and characterization techniques:
- Glove box operation and air-free chemistry
- X-ray diffraction
- Scanning electron microscopy
- Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis
- FTIR and Raman spectroscopy
- Electrochemical impedance (dielectric) spectroscopy
